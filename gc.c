 *          [reference count][allocated memory]
 *
 *      When it gets a call to gc_malloc it simply allocates the give size plus
 *      sizeof(int), and whenever it gets a call to gc_register or gc_free it
 *      shifts the address over by the size of an int to inspect the reference
 *      count.
